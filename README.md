## Project Description

This research presents an innovative solar cell design that integrates **micro-capacitors** and **micro-converters** directly into the chip, enabling **on-chip DC to AC energy conversion**. The goal is to minimize energy losses, reduce system size, and eliminate the need for external inverters ‚Äî leading to enhanced thermal management and improved energy conversion efficiency.

## Key Features

- üìâ **Up to 30% efficiency gain** compared to traditional inverter-based systems  
- üå°Ô∏è **Operational stability below 50¬∞C**, improving longevity and performance  
- üìà **Low waveform distortion** (2.3% THD), ensuring compatibility with AC grid systems  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Fully tested prototype** and simulation-validated design
